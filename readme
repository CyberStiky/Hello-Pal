Jack Murphy's Repository for use as a submission to IGN's Code-Foo Challenge.

This repository was originally created as a test when I couldn't figure out how to commit files to GitHub. It was so close to the deadline when I figured it out, I didn't take the time to create a more appropriate repository. I trust the test name, "Hello-Pal" Won't deter you from the substance contained within.

ChessRiddle.exe is a simple executable I wrote explaining my thoughts on the knight riddle.
GoldenGateBridge.txt is my answer to the penny placing scenario.
IGotWhatItTakes.txt is a link to a youtube video serving as my "creative" demonstration of 	my passion and commitment to the Code-Foo program.
ImageDimensions.txt is my answer to the design layout problem.
JackMurphy-Resume.txt is my informal resume. Quick bio, and rundown of my experience.

Time for some sweet.... sweeeet..... sleep....
